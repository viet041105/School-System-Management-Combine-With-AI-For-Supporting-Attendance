# AISchool


AISchool is a comprehensive AI-powered face detection and recognition system designed to streamline attendance and access control in educational environments. This project integrates cutting-edge computer vision models with a full-stack application comprising a Python-based AI service, a .NET Core backend API, and an ASP.NET Core frontend interface.

Key Features

Face Detection & Recognition: Utilizes YOLOv11n for real-time face detection and FaceNet embeddings for accurate identity verification.

Gallery Management: Builds and maintains a gallery of known faces with pre-computed embeddings (gallery_facenetID.pkl).

RESTful API: Exposes AI functionalities via a Python FastAPI service, handling video uploads and processing.

Backend Services: Implements a .NET 8 Web API (Backendd) for business logic, user management, and integration with the AI service.

Web Frontend: Provides an ASP.NET Core (Frontendd) user interface for administrators and staff to manage users, view attendance logs, and configure settings.

Database Integration: Includes Database.sql for schema setup and CRUD operations on students, classes, and attendance records.

 How It Works ðŸ”¹ 1. Register Faces Place images of each person into separate folders under Data/ImageReg/ (e.g. ImageReg/Alice, ImageReg/Bob).

Run gallery_module.py to extract face embeddings and save them to gallery_facenet1.pkl.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Process Video You can process a video locally with live display using:

bash Copy Edit python main.py What happens:

YOLOv11n detects faces every frame.

FaceNet compares them to the gallery.

Best face images are stored.

Final attendance is verified based on vote ratio.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Upload via API (Optional) Run FastAPI server:

bash Copy Edit uvicorn app:app --reload Send a request using curl or Postman:

bash Copy Edit curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/uploadvideo" -F "video=@/path/to/video.mp4" âœ… Output Example sql Copy Edit --- Final Attendance --- Alice confirmed with vote ratio: 0.85 Bob confirmed with vote ratio: 0.73

Best face images saved to: Data/best_faces

Warning: Unknown person detected in the video.
